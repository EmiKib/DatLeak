# DatLeak
Methods for detection of data leakage in dataset.


When using BIDSscramble, a tool designed to anonymize BIDS datasets by randomizing the data, it's important to implement safeguards against potential data leakage. Data leakage can occur if scrambled identifiers inadvertently retain patterns or metadata that could be traced back to original participants. Hence DatLeak can be run to test for data leakage.
